# MYSTRAN Documentation Breakdown and Process

For the MYSTRAN project, there are 4 major formal documents and also an "Other" directory:
- Quick Setup Guide
- User Manual
- Theory Manual
- Other Documents
- Release Notes

## Quick Setup Guide

The MYSTRAN program is a stand-alone executable, with no external dependencies. Because of this, it is straightforward to set up and run. However, for convenience, some additional options are presented in this guide: three options are presented. The first is the simplest and is sufficient for many users. The second and third options are more flexible.

## User Manual

The User Manual is the largest and most thorough document in the MYSTRAN documentation suite. It contains detailed information about how to use the program.

The User Manual is in MS Word (docx) because this is a good balance between design and flexibility. The Word document can then create a PDF, which will reside in this repo and the main MYSTRAN repo.

Modification Process:
Any document request changes/requests can be reported as a GitHub Issue. Then, for major releases (or every so often), the Word document is updated and a PDF is created. For minor changes, a variety of developers can implement the changes without oversight.
For significant changes, such as major section rewrites, it is recommended that changes be approved by at least one other developer.

## Theory Manual

The Theory Manual contains detailed information about the theory and math utilized for the MYSTRAN solver.

The theory manual is in MS Word (docx) because this is a good balance between design and flexibility. The Word document can then create a PDF, which will reside in this repo and the main MYSTRAN repo.

Modification Process:
Any document request changes/requests can be reported as a GitHub Issue. Then, for major releases (or every so often), the Word document is updated and a PDF is created. For minor changes, a variety of developers can implement the changes without oversight.

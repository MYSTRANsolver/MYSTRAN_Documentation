## Install and Run Manual

Install and Run Manual

## Quick Reference Guide

The Quick Reference Guide is the largest and most thorough document in the MYSTRAN documentation suite. It contains detailed information about the how to use the program.

The Quick Reference Guide is in MS Word (docx) because this is a good balance between design and flexibility. The Word document can then create a PDF, which will reside in this repo and the main MYSTRAN repo.

Modification Process:
Any document request changes/requests can be reported as a GitHub Issue. Then, for major releases (or every so often), the Word document is updated and a PDF is created. For minor changes, a variety of developers can implement the changes without oversight.
For significant changes, such as major section rewrites, it is recommended that changes be approved by at least one other developer.

## Theory Manual

The Theory Manual contains detailed information about the theory and math utilized for the MYSTRAN solver.

The theory manual is in MS Word (docx) because this is a good balance between design and flexibility. The Word document can then create a PDF, which will reside in this repo and the main MYSTRAN repo.

Modification Process:
Any document request changes/requests can be reported as a GitHub Issue. Then, for major releases (or every so often), the Word document is updated and a PDF is created. For minor changes, a variety of developers can implement the changes without oversight.
For significant changes, such as major section rewrites, it is recommended that changes be approved by at least one other developer.

## Release Notes

The Release Notes document is done with Markdown (MD). This document has minimal design requirements and using MD allows for ease of editing and tracking.
